# A handy guide to financial support for open source.
*"I do open source work, how do I find funding?"*

Below I've listed every way I know of that people get paid for work on [free/libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) projects, roughly ordered from small to large. Each funding category links to several real examples. (Wherever possible, I've tried to link to a useful article or page instead of just a homepage.)

The categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, a project might have a foundation but also use crowdfunding to raise money. Someone else might do consulting and also have a donation button. Etc. The purpose of this guide is to provide an exhaustive list of all the ways you can get paid, so that you can figure out what works best for you.

**"personal effort" notes when a funding effort was led by an individual, not a project*

## Donation button

#### Pros
* Few strings attached
* Little work involved: "set it and forget it"

####Cons
* Usually not much money unless you have dedicated fundraising efforts
* Need a legal entity to donate to (ex. [SFC](http://sfconservancy.org), [OpenCollective](http://opencollective.com) are fiscal sponsors for this purpose). Harder for individuals or international donations to manage
* Sometimes not clear who “deserves” money in a project or how it gets distributed

####Case Studies
* [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WhyDonate)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/sfc)
* [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/)

##Bounties

####Pros
* Open to community participation
* Money is tied to doing specific work (more like paying for service than donations)
* Especially popular for security work

####Cons
* Can create perverse incentives in a project (low quality PRs, distracting priorities)
* Usually not much money per bounty (~<$500)
* Doesn’t provide recurring revenue

####Case Studies
* [Bountysource](http://bountysource.com)

####Pros
* Few strings attached
* Can be easier for an individual to legally manage via, ex. [Kickstarter](https://kickstarter.com/)

####Cons

##Grants

####Pros
* Fewer strings attached
* Guaranteed money can help project focus for an unbroken period of time
* Gives project room to breathe and experiment

####Cons
* Consulting requires human power, doesn’t scale well (except for rare outliers)

* [Baroque Software](http://baroquesoftware.com/)
* [OpenSSL](http://openssl.com/what.html)

##SaaS
SaaS stands for [Software as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)

####Pros
* Can build community around open project and make money off of services for hosting
* Allows open source project to focus on users and as needs grow to help enterprises adopt the project
* Can scale by number of users

####Cons
* Often means the hosting needs to be cheaper than hiring a dev to run the project for you.
* “Two tiers” of product support can make free users unhappy

####Case Studies
* [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/)
* [Moodle](https://moodle.org/)
* [Forge Laravel](https://forge.laravel.com/)

* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)

##[Open core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_core)


####Pros
* Business model aligned with something people are willing to pay for
* Can scale well if successful

####Cons
* Need to have something you can charge for (which often means making certain features exclusive)

* [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/)

##Foundations & consortiums

####Pros
* Neutrality. Foundation protects the code and helps steward community
* Influence distributed across multiple donors
* Can legitimize project, companies might feel more comfortable giving to foundations than individuals

####Cons
* Only really worth it for big projects
* Difficult to set up for IRS reasons (many do 501c6 instead of 501c3), restrictions on what you can do
* Requires serious community effort and diverse skills (you still need to fundraise after setting up the entity!)

####Case Studies
* [Ruby Together](http://rubytogether.org/)
* [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/)
* [Node.js Foundation](https://www.sitepoint.com/goodbye-joyent-hello-node-js-foundation/)

##Venture capital

####Pros
* Institutional support can be helpful for growing a business
* Large amounts of capital available

####Cons
* Venture capital comes with expectations of an exit (i.e. returning the money to investors at a multiple). History suggests this is structurally difficult to achieve for open source businesses
* Venture capital can change motivations and distract from priorities

####Case Studies
* [Npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/76320673650/funding)
* [Confluent](http://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-raises-a-series-b-funding)
